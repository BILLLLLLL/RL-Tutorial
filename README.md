# RL-Tutorial
A gentle introduction to reinforcement learning (RL) in terms of conceptual and programming perspectives. There will be 5 different parts, where we will build from the ground up in terms of understanding the subject. Every single section will have its own jupyter notebook and students are expected to finish them on their own.

## 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Gym

## 2. Classical Algorithms for RL and Introduction to Deep RL

## 3. The REINFORCE Algorithm (Policy Gradients)

## 4. Actor-Critic Algorithm

## 5. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
